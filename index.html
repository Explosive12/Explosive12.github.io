                <h3>Virtual reality (VR)</h3>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality has been used more and more, you will see it mostly in the gaming industry, however
                    you
                    can unsurprisingly also use it for the sports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you somehow don't know what VR is, it is a gadget where you have some sort of glasses on your
                    head,
                    and experience something like you were right at the place where the stuff is happening. Meaning the
                    user
                    also could use it for sports to have a more fun experience. The user also, has some controls to
                    maybe
                    play themselves some.
                </p>


                <p>
                    One of the sports where the VR headset really shines is American football, so have multiple NFL
                    teams
                    implemented
                    VR training, to for example have a sharper vision or a better reaction time on an enemy attack.

                <h3>Sleep Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    Sleep tracking is probably as simple as what you were thinking, tracking your sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Athletes always do this as well, to maybe prevent an injury because they were to tired or maybe to
                    even
                    know if its a good idea to join in on the sport at that moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Athletes want to estimate if their reaction time will be at their peak, studies have also proven
                    that
                    less sleep means that their overall performance decreases by a bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sleep is usually tracked by something as simple as a watch or a wristband. These things have
                    been
                    developed so much that they can track your different stages of sleep. This is done by tracking your
                    heart rate and your movements while sleeping.
                </p>

                <h3>Movement Tracking</h3>
                <p>
                    Movement tracking is just as it says as well, it tracks someones movement. In sports this will be
                    most
                    of the time the Athletes
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be used really well, the life of sport coaches has been made a lot easier because of this,
                    because these people do not have to watch the athlete really well the entire time in the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    tracking movement is usually done with computers alongside some devices to catch the movement like a
                    wearable device or accessoires attached to sporting clothes and other stuff.
                    When the information gets send to the computer the coaches can easily break down their movement and
                    tell
                    the athlete what is going well and what can be improved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tracking movement can also be used to maybe find stuff that the athlete is doing in a bad way before
                    it
                    will become a big problem in their life, like maybe they throw the ball in a weird way that can hurt
                    their muscle in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So basically this is best used to prevent injuries and signicant downtime before they actually
                    happen
                </p>
