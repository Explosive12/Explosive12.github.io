        <h2>Global</h2>
        <p>The Virtual reality is a machine you can put on your head. With this machine you could experience things
            like never before. Vr makes it possible to be at that one spot in the moment. The VR is regularly seen
            in the gaming industry, however recently the vr has been showing up more and more in the sports industry
            to capture maybe a goal a player made. Its a screen with 360 degrees of vision.
        </p>

        <p>The VR has a few buttons to maybe play a game with or scroll through stuff in the form of 2 small
            controllers. This device is usually also connected to a device.</p>
    </article>

    <article id="Grid-Solve">
        <h2>Solves</h2>
        <p>Have you ever felt like pretending your in a sports game but without actually going outside, or having to
            deal with other people at all! Well its
            made easier with this, here you can train yourself without the risk of getting injuries from the sport
            itself. Its also ofcourse possible to do while having an injury, you can then just practice with the vr and
            controllers at home with
            limited movement. </p>
    </article>

    <article id="Grid-Use">
        <h2>Use</h2>
        <p>The use of the VR is pretty self explanatory, you can pratice stuff that is normally done on the field,
            just at home. This is very ideal for athletes who suffer from an injury because of a previous game. Now
            they can practice on the VR instead of not at all, you can also just use this thing to ofcourse just
            watch the athletes playing rugby or any other sport live with your vr</p>
    </article>

    <article id="Grid-Who">
        <h2>Who uses it</h2>
        <p>These past few years there has been a rise of the use of this product, so has Mark Zuckeburg recently
            started a project called metaVerse. (Which seems to be a big failure) where you are in an entire virtual
            world and are able to do almost anything you like to. You probably also have heard that sport companies
            started to use this to make viewing the sportsgame possible online</p>
    </article>

    <article id="Grid-What">
        <h2>Expectation</h2>
        <p>
            What is there to expect when buying the VR, well you can expect a device to put on your head to have a
            full 360 degrees view of a place, this place can be basically anything, maybe you search up a place in
            google maps and you can kinda pretend that you're right there next to the Eiffel Tower. Hopefully there
            will also be a small set of controllers where you can move around with to detect your movement, or
            inputs you do.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article id="Grid-Future">
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p> What will we see in the future? Well ofcourse with any electronic you can expect the performance of the
            device to keep being better and better. Secondly you can expect to watch full games live in the future
            on this device. Lastly the motion sickness people get from being too long in here will be reduced by
            quite a bit, so you can fully enjoy your experience on here</p>
